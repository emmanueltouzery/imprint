# IMprint

![Main view detail](https://raw.github.com/wiki/emmanueltouzery/imprint/main_window.png)

Imprint can add text labels on your pictures, like the date on which a picture was taken. But besides this, it can add many more types of data, like exposition time, ISO.. And you can format the date to your liking.

You can pick the text style from a collection:

Or customize the style yourself:

And it is possible to place several display items on a single picture, top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right.

Besides English, Imprint is also translated in French and Slovenian languages.

To install the application on linux, install the haskell platform, get this git repository and run:

	cabal install

The application will register in the menus on linux, however for it to actually run, you must add ~/.cabal/bin to your path.

Compilation on windows is extremely messy, for that reason just download the pre-made package and unzip it anywhere on your disk and run the .exe.
